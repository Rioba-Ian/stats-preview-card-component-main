## My process

I quickly started with the mobile design. Designing mobile was quite fast I can tell you. I used knowledge from a previous challenge of the nft preview card where you have a parent img container and an overlay div inside it. Set the parent container to relative and the overlay to absolute with top, left, right and bottom to zero. 

For mobile I used flex. 

When I tried using flexbox in desktop, setting widths for img and the text container couldn't just work. I learnt grid and applied it in this challenge. I then applied flex justify content around to the text container. Grid is just superb. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

I definitely used grid for the first time and it was exquisite. I learnt to change the background color in terms of light, hue and saturation of an img. 


### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid by Wes Bos](https://www.example.com) - This really taught me grid for the first time and then apply it.
